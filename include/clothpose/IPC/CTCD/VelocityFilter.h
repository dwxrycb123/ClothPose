    /* Given a mesh with initial vertex positions qstart, triangle faces faces
       (each column of faces specifies one triagle), and candidate ending
       positions qend, resolves collisions by perturbing the ending positions (a
       velocity filter). qend is overwritten with new ending positions. The mesh
       does not need to be manifold, nor must the faces be oriented: however, it
       is assumed that all vertices are part of at least one face (otherwise the
       algorithm aborts and returns DANGLING_VERTICES.) The collision forces
       will respect the lumped inverse masses *per DOF* in the masses vector.
       You can give some DOFs infinite mass by setting the corresponding entries
       to zero, and the algorithm will cope (if possible). outerEta and innerEta
       control the extent of the contact forces: primitives further than
       outerEta apart will feel no force, and primitives approaching innerEta
       apart will feel infinite force. The input mesh qstart must not contain
       any vertex-face or edge-edge pairs that are already closer than innerEta
       apart. If it does, the algorithm aborts and returns
       STARTING_STATE_INTERSECTS. The starting positions should also be free of
       intersections, but the algorithm will not check for this. Any collisions
       present in the initial configuration will be maintained in the output.
       The other parameters control the physics of the contact response. The
       coefficient of restitution CoR should be strictly positive and introduces
       damping into the simulation. Set it to 1.0 for perfectly elastic
       response. With default parameters for the step size and stiffness
       parameters, the algorithm will attempt to guess a good stiffness and
       substep size given the maximum velocity and minimum mass in the system.
       You can override this guess by manually adjusting the stiffness and/or
       substep size parameters. If the stiffness is too large for the time step,
       the simulation will blow up and never terminate. If too small, it may
       take many layers and many iterations to find a solution. maxRollbacks
       controls how many iterations the algorithm will take before giving up and
       returning MAXROLLBACKS_EXCEEDED. Even if the simulation does not blow up,
       it is possible for the algorithm to never terminate if the input contains
       impossible geometry (e.g. due to conflicting constraints caused by
       infinite-mass regions) or if the problem is so hard that the size of the
       layers reduces to close to the machine epsilon. If the algorithm
       succeeds, it returns the number of outer iterations that were needed to
       resolve all contacts. A negative number indicates a detected error (see
       above).
